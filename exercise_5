# Chapter 5 Iteration
# Exercise 1: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters
# “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the
# numbers. If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using
# try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.

total = 0
count = 0
average = 0
answer = 0

while True:
    answer = input('Enter a number: ')
    if answer =='done':
        break
    try:
        num = float(answer)
    except:
        print('Invalid input')
        continue
    total = total + num
    count = count+1
    average = total/count
   
print(total,count,average)

    
# Exercise 2: Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers as above and at the
# end prints out both the maximum and minimum of the numbers instead of the average.

maximum = None
minimum = None
count = 0
while True:
    answer = input("enter again: ")
    if answer == 'done':
        break
    try:
        num = float(answer)
    except:
        print('invalid input')
        continue
    if maximum is None:
        maximum = num
    if minimum is None:
        minimum = num
    if maximum < num:
        maximum = num
    if minimum > num:
        minimum = num
    count=count+1
print(maximum,minimum,count)
